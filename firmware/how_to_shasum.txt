Generate the checksum:
shasum -a 256 firmware_20200724B.bin >> checksum_R20200724B.txt

Check the checksum:
The "controller" for the UVC cabinet is actually a microcontroller
running an embedded operating system and software ("firmware"). The firmware
is compiled and then able to be downloaded directly to the microcontroller
via its USB cable. To ensure that the software has not been tampered with,
all versions of the firmware will be provided with a SHA-256 checksum. 
A checksum is an algorithmic means of checking the integrity of the file.
So, in order to verify the integrity of the firmware (ending in .bin), 
merely download it, and the matching
checksum_<xxx>.txt files to the same folder. Then perform the following commands.

Using a Mac Terminal program or Linux command line:
shasum -a 256 -c < checksum_R20200724B.txt 

The desired output should read as follows: <filename>: OK
Example:
shasum -a 256 -c < checksum_R20200724B.txt
firmware_R20200724B.bin: OK       

Using Windows Prompt*:
certutil -hashfile uvc_controller_reboot.bin SHA256 

*Note that I don't know how to compare to an existing checksum file using Windows
command Prompt, so you will have to compare and verify the SHA-256 checksum value with the official checksum by hand.
