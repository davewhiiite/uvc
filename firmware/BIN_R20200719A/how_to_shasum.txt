 Generate the checksum:
shasum -a 256 uvc_controller_reboot.bin >> checksum_R20200719A.txt

Check the checksum:
The "controller" for the UVC cabinet is actually a microcontroller
running an embedded operating system and software ("firmware"). The firmware
is compiled and then able to be downloaded directly to the microcontroller
via its USB cable. To ensure that the software has not been tampered with,
all versions of the firmware will be provided with an SHA-256 checksum. 
A checksum is an algorithmic means of checking the integrity of the file.
So, in order to verify the integrity of the file, merely download it, and the
checksum_<xxx>.txt files to the same folder. Using a mac Terminal program or


Using Linux command line:
shasum -a 256 -c < checksum_R20200719A.txt

Using Windows Prompt:
certutil -hashfile uvc_controller_reboot.bin SHA256
